# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

MiniPos — a point-of-sale system for a Lao retail shop. Plain PHP 8.2 + MySQL on XAMPP, jQuery + AdminLTE 3 (Bootstrap 4) on the front end. No Composer, no npm, no build step, no test suite. Files are edited and served directly.

UI text, DB seed data, and most code comments are in Lao (some Thai). Keep new user-facing strings in Lao to match.

## Running it

Served by XAMPP Apache from the working directory:

- App: `http://localhost/MiniPos/` (redirects to `auth/login.php`)
- DB: MySQL `minipos`, user `root`, empty password — hardcoded in `config/db.php`
- Timezone is forced to `Asia/Vientiane`; invoice numbers and reports depend on it

There is nothing to build. Edit a file, reload the page.

Debugging goes through the server logs, since there are no tests:

```bash
# PHP fatals / warnings (this is the fastest way to find a broken page or AJAX call)
tail -c 200000 "D:/xampp/apache/logs/error.log" | grep -a "PHP"

# Which endpoints the browser actually hit
tail -c 500000 "D:/xampp/apache/logs/access.log" | grep -a "pos_backend"
```

To exercise an endpoint without a browser, forge a session file and POST to it. `session.save_path` is `D:\xampp\tmp`:

```bash
php -r 'file_put_contents("D:/xampp/tmp/sess_testsession0000000000abc","user_id|i:1;checked|i:1;last_activity|i:".time().";");'
curl -s -b "PHPSESSID=testsession0000000000abc" -X POST "http://localhost/MiniPos/api/pos_backend.php" --data-urlencode 'action=checkout' --data-urlencode 'cart=[...]'
```

Checkout writes real rows to `tbsale_save`, `tbsale_save_detail`, `sales` and decrements `products.qty`. Use a nonexistent `product_id` to test the request plumbing without writing (the transaction rolls back), and clean up after any test that actually succeeds.

## Architecture

### The iframe shell

`home/dashboard.php` is the master layout and the only page that renders `layouts/sidebar.php`. Everything under `pages/` loads inside `<iframe name="frame">`. Consequences that matter constantly:

- Sidebar links use `target="frame"`; pages themselves never include the sidebar
- A page that needs to redirect the whole app must break out of the frame: `echo "<script>window.top.location.href = '...'</script>"` — a plain `header('Location:')` only navigates the iframe
- `dashboard.php` picks the initial iframe `src` by walking the user's permissions, so a user with no `dashboard` permission lands on the first module they can see
- Root-level `dashboard.php`, `home.php`, `logout.php`, `check_user.php` are one-line `require_once` shims to the real files in `home/` and `auth/`

### config/db.php does far more than connect

Every request includes it, and it:

- Opens **both** `$conn` (mysqli) and `$pdo` (PDO). New code should use `$pdo` with prepared statements; `$conn` survives in older paths
- Starts the session, enforces a 15-minute idle timeout, and re-reads `tbuser` to rebuild `$_SESSION['permissions']`, `status`, `store_id` on **every** request — so a permission change takes effect on the user's next page load, and stale session data is not a thing to work around
- Logs a non-admin out if their branch's `tbstore.status` is not `active`
- Runs a long block of **idempotent auto-migrations on every request**: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `SHOW COLUMNS` + `ALTER TABLE ADD`, column renames, index creation, and `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` for a deprecated-table list. This is how the schema evolves — there are no migration files. To add a column, append a guarded block here rather than altering the DB by hand, or it will be missing on other installs. Note the flip side: adding a table name to the `$unusedTables` array silently drops it on the next request.
- Defines the global helpers every page relies on: `hasPermission()`, `getActiveStoreId()`, `isMainBranch()`, `getSetting()`, `formatCurrency()`, `logActivity()`, `resolveBankLogo()`, `resolveBankQr()`, `getLowStockAlerts()`

### Permissions

`hasPermission($module, $action)` is the single gate, checked both at the top of each page (to block access) and inline around buttons (to hide actions). It resolves in this order:

1. Admin bypass — `user_id === 1`, or `status` is `ຜູ້ບໍລິຫານ` / `admin` / `super admin`
2. A per-user override row in `user_permission_switch_states`, keyed `perm_<module>_<action>_<userId>` where action is one of `view|add|edit|del`
3. Fall back to the boolean column on `tbuser` for the module

`$module` goes through an alias map inside the function (`pos`→`sale`, all the report pages→`report`, all the settings pages→`setup`, …). When adding a module, add it to the alias map, to the `$_SESSION['permissions']` array built in `config/db.php`, and to `layouts/sidebar.php`.

### Multi-branch

`tbstore` holds branches; `store_id` is carried on `products`, `sales`, `tbsale_save`, `customers`, `imports`, `accounting_records`, `tbuser`.

Always scope queries with `getActiveStoreId($pdo)` — never `$_SESSION['store_id']` directly. A sub-branch user is hard-locked to their own branch; an admin or main-branch user can switch via `?switch_store_id=N`, which parks the choice in `$_SESSION['active_store_id']`.

### Page composition

Every page under `pages/` follows the same shape:

```php
session_start();
$scriptDir = str_replace('\\', '/', dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] ?? ''));
$base_path = (basename($scriptDir) === 'pages') ? '../' : '../../';
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../api/<module>_backend.php';  // auth + POST handling + data fetch
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../layouts/header.php';
// ... HTML, reading the $variables the backend prepared ...
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../layouts/footer.php';
```

`$base_path` must be right or every asset 404s. Pages one level deep (`pages/pos/`) use `../../`; pages under `pages/settings/*/` hardcode `../../../`.

`layouts/header.php` opens `<html>` and `<body>` and bails to the login page if the session is missing; `layouts/footer.php` closes them. Header also loads jQuery/Bootstrap/SweetAlert2 **in `<head>`** so inline page scripts can use `$` and `Swal` immediately, monkey-patches `Swal.fire` to auto-dismiss success toasts after 1.8s, and actively unregisters any leftover service worker (`manifest.json` still advertises offline mode, but the SW is deliberately disabled).

Setting `$pos_page = true` before including the header suppresses the global navigation preloader.

### api/*_backend.php is dual-purpose

These files are **not** a REST layer. Each one is both:

- the controller `require_once`'d by its page — handles `$_POST['action']`, sets `$message`/`$message_type`, and prepares the `$variables` the view renders
- a direct AJAX target — when hit with an action it recognises, it sets `Content-Type: application/json`, echoes, and `exit()`s

So the same file must stay safe to include mid-page *and* to call standalone. Guard AJAX branches on both the method and the action, and `exit()` before any HTML would be emitted. `pos_backend.php` is the clearest example: `checkout` and `add_customer_ajax` exit early with JSON, and everything past them is page-load data fetching.

Purely-JSON endpoints exist too, and don't follow the pattern: `pages/{categories,products,users_manage}/api_*.php` and `auth/check_user.php`.

Reports are the other variation — `pages/reports/partials/reports_backend.php` is shared by several report pages, each seeding `$_GET['view_mode']` (`invoice` or `item`) before including it.

### The POS page

`pages/pos/pos.php` composes `partials/` (markup) and `partials/js/*.php` (behaviour, split by concern: cart, checkout, barcode, customer, bills). Server state reaches JS through `window.*` globals set in `pos.php` (`POS_BACKEND_URL`, `POS_STORE_ID`, `POS_TODAY_SALE_COUNT`, `CURRENT_USER_NAME`) and through `var allProducts = <?php echo json_encode($products); ?>` in `partials/pos_js.php`.

Checkout posts `cart` as a **JSON string** and the backend `json_decode`s it. Keep it a string — passing the array through jQuery makes PHP receive `cart[0][product_id]=...` as an array instead.

The whole sale runs in one PDO transaction: insert bill → per item `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, validate stock, insert detail, `UPDATE products SET qty = qty - ?` → commit. Any shortfall rolls back and returns `{success: false, message}`. Products with `cut_qty = 0` (services, non-stock items) are sold without decrementing. The response carries `updated_stocks`, which the client uses to repaint stock counts without a reload.

### Assets and cache busting

Third-party libs live in `plugins/` (jQuery, Bootstrap, SweetAlert2, Select2, FontAwesome, overlayScrollbars, tempusdominus, iCheck), AdminLTE in `dist/`, plus a top-level `ionicons-2.0.1/`. Per-page stylesheets are in `themes/<page>.css`, shared ones in `assets/css/`.

Stylesheets are cache-busted with `?v=<?php echo filemtime(__DIR__ . '/../../themes/x.css'); ?>`. A wrong relative depth here doesn't just 404 the stylesheet — `filemtime()` warns into the Apache log and prints into the page. `pages/settings/stores/index.php:259` copied the two-level form into a three-level directory and resolves to `pages/themes/settings.css`, which doesn't exist.

## Gotchas

- **`pages/settings/*/` has duplicate entry points.** The sidebar always links to `index.php`. In some folders `index.php` is a shim that requires `<name>.php`; in others (`stores`, `printers`) `index.php` holds the live code and `<name>.php` is a stale near-copy. Trace from `index.php` before editing, or the change won't show up.
- **Absolute paths are hardcoded.** `resolveBankLogo()` / `resolveBankQr()` in `config/db.php` embed `D:/xampp/htdocs/MiniPos`, and `api/database_backend.php` looks for `C:/xampp/mysql/bin/mysqldump.exe` (falling back to a PHP-based dump into `backups/` when absent).
- **`hasPermission()` ignores its `$action` argument for the column fallback.** Only the `user_permission_switch_states` path distinguishes view/add/edit/delete; without an override row, any action resolves to plain module access.
- **Passwords accept several formats.** `auth/check_user.php` tries bcrypt, SHA-256, plaintext, and legacy MySQL `PASSWORD()` in turn.
- Auto-migration blocks in `config/db.php` swallow every exception (`catch (Throwable $ex) {}`). A migration that fails fails silently — confirm with `SHOW COLUMNS` rather than assuming it applied.

## Commits

Recent history uses conventional prefixes with an English summary: `fix: disable HTTP cache on get_live_stocks API`, `feat: dynamically pull selected bank QR code ...`. Older commits are bare `update`; follow the newer style.
